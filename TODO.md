### Next Steps
- [x] Read in dataset from command line (dynamically setting ranges)
- [ ] Move each display to it's own thread
- [x] Rectangular selection highlights points
- [ ] Events processed using 0MQ
- [ ] Multiple views supported in corner plot (switch via command/meta-key)
- [ ] General text drawing
- [ ] Histogram view doesnt include other views (only the histogram)
- [ ] Plot titles
- [ ] Fix Axis labels
- [x] Top and left plots in unison
- [ ] Handle negative axis ranges
- [ ] Separate adding points and displaying (plot functions)

### Types of views in corner display
- [ ] Median with std dev circles around selected points
- [x] Histogram (x-axis/y-axis combined)
- [ ] Correlation

### Thoughts or nice-to-haves
- [ ] Dotted lines for grid
- [ ] Dynamically resize plot area
- [ ] Non-scatterplot views in upper/lower plots
